Given that PROVIDEDCODE = ./the/path/to/the/provided/projectsrc.jar
You can use the following UNIX based command line to compile the example submission:

javac -cp $PROVIDEDCODE:./src/ ./src/sXXXXXXXXX/sXXXXXXXXXPlayer.java 



You can run the demo agent using the following UNIX based command line:

java -cp $PROVIDEDCODE:./src/ boardgame.Client sXXXXXXXXX.sXXXXXXXXXPlayer


Note that this command should also work with windows if you correct the classpath (what comes immediately after -cp). You might have to correct the file path format and replace ':' with ';'.
